## Problem Statement
Task is to analyse data from various sources, extract valuable insights by looking at it combinedly & then provide actionable recommendations to improve the operations.

## Analysis
I used Google BigQuery data-warehouse to store & analyse data using [SQL queries](). I also created a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rahul2575/viz/Retailanalysis_16790631662820/Timedashboard) to visualize the important insights in form of charts.
Here are some snippets of the visualization
